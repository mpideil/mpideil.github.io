![Airport]([[!!images/airport.png]])

In this post, we are going to explore the ip stack a bit

<!--more-->

* Target
    * Webserver (www.target.com)
* Question
    * Is it a standalone server ? Is it a web farm ?
* Hint
    * RFC0791: Identification (16 bits) = An identifying
   value assigned by the sender to aid in assembling the
   fragments of a datagram.


Exemple :
```
	[protean:/pentest]$ scapy
	Welcome to Scapy (1.2.0.2)
	>>> res,unans=sr(IP(dst=“www.target.com”)/TCP(sport=[RandShort()]*1000))
	Begin emission:
	......*****.***.**.***.*.*.***..*.* Finished to send 1000 packets.
	**...*.*.**..*.**..*................
	Received 1822 packets, got 1000 answers, remaining 0 packets
	>>> res.plot(lambda (s,r): r.id)
```

Thre result is :
![IP_Stack1]([[!!assets/images/oneStack.png]])
Here with 1 ip stack.

![IP_Stack8]([[!!assets/images/eightStack.png]])
With 8 ip stacks.
