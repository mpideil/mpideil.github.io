<p>I had my first experiences with IT very early, it is a family story. Development
and web development at first, then I was more interested in Linux environment and
bringing them to their best.</p>
<p>I left the south of France for Belgium, and then for the north of France. Now I want to settle
in the United States, my birth country.</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy your visit on my website.</p>
